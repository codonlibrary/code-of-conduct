# Codon Code of Conduct
## Report handling procedure
This document aims to present the way we handle recieved reports. This is not a complete guide, but rather, a set of guidelines or best practices that guide the way we provide support to users of codon. Each issue is different and requires individual consideration on a case-to-case basis.

### How we receive reports
All reports received by us are usually sent to **email**.

### Response Time
We aim to respond to all reports within 24 hours of the email being recieved. However, the actions taken upon a report could take up to 7 days based on the complexity of the report and the evidence that we have collected.

### Initial response
We aim to provide clarity on the reports we recieve and therefore will send an initial email to acknowledge your report has been viewed. As stated in the response time, we aim to respond to all reports within 24 hours of recieving them.

### Decision-making process
The process with which decisions are made differ slightly between issues, due to the fact that each issue is slightly different. However, there is a loosely defined set of stages in which we will review a report.
- **Reviewer** - The committee decides on a reviewer for the issue
- **Contacting the reporter** - The reviewer should contact the reporter once they have viewed the inital report. This email will contain the initial response.
- **Initial inspection** - The reviewer will conduct an initial inspection of the report and gather any relevant evidence that might help support the reporters claims. If the evidence is conclusive, A deciding action will be discussed.
- **Reponse to the reviewer (If required)** - After the reviewer makes an inital inspection, a response may be sent back to the reporter if the evidence provided is inconclusive or a lack of evidence has been provided (You may be asked to provide more evidence).
- **Final inspection** - If a response to the reviwer has taken place, the reviewer will re-evaluate the report and actions shall be discussed and decided.
- **Deciding action** - Based on the evidence provided, the reviewer will discuss and propose an action to the other members of the committee. If all members of the committee agree on the action taken, the reviewer will get in contact with the subject of the report. 
- **Report will be logged** - Whether the report results in any actions, it will be recorded.
