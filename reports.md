# Codon Code of Conduct
## Report handling procedure
This document aims to present the ways users of Codon can issue reports. Please be aware that each issue is different and requires individual consideration on a case-to-case basis.

### Want to create a report?
You can send a report to [codon.library@nhs.net](mailto:codon.library@nhs.net)

### Response Time
We aim to respond to all reports within 24 hours of the email being recieved. However, the actions taken upon a report could take up to 7 days based on the complexity of the report and the evidence that we have collected.

### Initial response
We aim to provide clarity on the reports we recieve and therefore will send an initial email to acknowledge your report has been viewed. As stated in the response time, we aim to respond to all reports within 24 hours of recieving them.
