# Codon Code of Conduct

## Record-Keeping
Regardless of the outcome, we record all reports and outcomes in our records, with the following fields:

- **Date of 1st report** (for time tracking)
- **Reporter, if official/public, Code of Conduct representative if private.** We do not name private reporters here. Therefore, the code of conduct representative handling the case instead
- **Named subjects.** The people or usernames who prompted the report.
- **Subject email address/URL.**
- **Summary of report.** A confidential summary of the nature of the report
- **Actions taken?** Anything involving contacting the subject of the report counts as an action
- **Banned of flagged?** 
- **Date to expunge this record.**

These records are used to form our [statistics](statistics.md).

## Data retention of records
Records are currently stored in a SQL database and access is only granted to members of the Review commitee in Codon Python. The committee insists on not sharing the records outside the members due to confidentiality of information. Violating this will result in the removal of the member from the committee.

Once a member steps down from the committee, their access to the records is removed. Newly added committee members recieve access to all previous records too.

## Flagged and banned status in committee records
The committee records all reported incidents, regardless of who reported them, who handled them, or whether they were found to be a violation. Records can be groued in one of four types:
- The committee assessed no violation occurred.
- A violation occurred and was resolved as far as the committee is concerned.
- A violation occurred and the user has been flagged, due to convern about their behaviour as of the date recorded.
- A violation occurred and the user has been banned temporarily or permanently.

Flagging is a rare scenario, where the violation was dealt with, but the committee feels that there is a risk that this person may commit further violations, or, has already committed violations within our current records. A user is unlikely to be flagged unless they have committed violations in the past or have displayed intentions of commiting violations in the future.
